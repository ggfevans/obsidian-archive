# Simple Archiver for Obsidian

> _Move old, stinky notes and folders to an archive, where they belong!_

Simple Archiver moves files or an entire folder to an archive folder that you configure. The items are moved to the same relative path in the archive folder.

Archiving can be done via:

-   `Simple Archive: Move to archive` command
-   `Move to archive` file menu item
-   `Move all to archive` multi-file menu item

## Planned Improvements

-   Archiving a folder that already exists in the archive merges the contents
-   Archiving a file that already exists in the archive gives the option to rename
-   Unarchive a file or folder
